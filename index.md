# My Quant Finance Studies
This website is a portfolio of everything that I have studied over the course of my Masters Programme in Quantitative Finance at the University of Manchester.

Bio:
I am a motivated Quantitative Finance student with 3 years of experience within the financial services industry. I deepened my interest in the technical and analytical side of derivatives through a Quantitative Finance MSc, and further researching the relevant areas, including stochastic calculus, probability theory as well as the pricing of a variety of derivatives, both vanilla and exotic. 

My CV includes 3 years of experience at IHS Markit (now part of S&P Market Intelligence), where I started out as a point of contact for clients on queries regarding their valuations, and slowly transitioned to being an Interest Rates Products specialist, working with Quant teams on deep diving rates valuations, as well as worked on development of new exotic products.
