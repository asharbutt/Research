Showing whether a process is a true martingale or not can be a difficult problem. Novikovs Condition is sufficient to show whether a process is a true martingale or not.

Recall that for an Ito Integral to be local martingale, the following has to hold:

$$\int _{0}^{T} \Delta ^2(s)ds < \infty$$

We want to show that the
