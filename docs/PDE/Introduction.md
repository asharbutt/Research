# Introduction
PDE's are multivariable functions where the dependent variable is a function of more than one independent variables and their derivatives. This is what seperates it from an Ordinary Differential Equation, which is only a function of one independent variable.
They can be used to model the evolution of the dependent variable w.r.t other inputs, which are called **spatial variables**.

A simple way of representing the PDE is as a function of all the variables. Say we have a function u = u(x,y), i.e. the variable u is a function of x and y. The PDE for u can be written as $F(x,y,u,u_x, u_y, u_{xx}, u_{yy}, u_{xy})$


The order of the PDE is the highest derivative present in the equation. Examples include the below:

1st Order:

2nd Order:
