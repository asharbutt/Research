# Chebyshev's Inequality
If we do not know the exact parameters needed to calculate the probability of a random variable taking a certain value, we can calculate upper (and lower) bounds to what the probability may be.

If we know the mean and standard deviation of a random variable, then the probability that the random variable will take a value outside of **k** standard deviations is given by the upper bound:

$P(|X-\mu| \geq k\sigma^2) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}$
