# Euler Scheme Finite Difference method (IN PROGRESS)
The Euler scheme is a simple method where we discretise the PDE. In our case, we look at the simple second order Black Scholes PDE:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}rS + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}\sigma^2 S^2 = rV $$
