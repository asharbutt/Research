# EXCEL Add-In
I used an XLL template repository to develop the basic framework for the XLL Addin, which I edit to add in my own functions needed. The add-in currently contains functions to value Black-Scholes Options, their greeks, implied volatility.

The add-in contains two categories: Financial valuation tools - valuing options etc (more are being added in) and mathematics tools e.g. integration methods etc (more are being added in)

The original template for the XLL framework can be found here: https://github.com/xlladdins/xll_template
